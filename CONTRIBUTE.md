# Contributing to BEAR AI LLM

## Open Code, Closed Source

BEAR AI LLM is **open code but not open source**. This distinction is important for legal professionals and enterprise users who need transparency while maintaining intellectual property protection.

### What This Means

- **Open Code**: The source code is publicly viewable for transparency, security auditing, and compliance verification
- **Closed Source**: The code is proprietary and contributions from external sources are not accepted
- **Legal Transparency**: Legal professionals can review the code to ensure compliance with data protection regulations

## Why This Model?

### For Legal Professionals
- **Compliance Verification**: Review code to ensure GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory compliance
- **Security Auditing**: Verify that PII is handled properly and data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Trust Through Transparency**: Understand exactly how your sensitive legal data is processed

### For Enterprise Users
- **IP Protection**: Maintain competitive advantages while providing transparency
- **Quality Control**: Ensure consistent, professionally maintained codebase
- **Support Structure**: Professional support channels for enterprise deployments
