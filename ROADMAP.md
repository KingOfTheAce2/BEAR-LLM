UPDATE DISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS:

  Yes, there are several ways to implement central update distribution for users with this Tauri application
  installed:

  Available Update Mechanisms:

  1. Tauri Built-in Auto-Updater (Recommended)

  - How: Uses tauri-plugin-updater with signed updates
  - Implementation: Configure update server URL in tauri.conf.json, app checks for updates on startup
  - Pros: Built-in, secure (code signing), automatic
  - Cons: Requires update server infrastructure

  2. GitHub Releases Auto-Update

  - How: Leverage GitHub Releases API with tauri-plugin-updater
  - Implementation: App checks GitHub releases, downloads/installs newer versions
  - Pros: Free hosting, easy CI/CD integration
  - Cons: Public repository required

  3. Custom Update Server

  - How: Build REST API that serves update manifests and binaries
  - Implementation: App polls server for updates, downloads delta/full updates
  - Pros: Full control, private updates, analytics
  - Cons: Server infrastructure required

  4. Enterprise Distribution Platforms

  - How: Deploy through Microsoft Store, internal app stores, or MDM solutions
  - Implementation: Platform handles update distribution
  - Pros: Enterprise-ready, IT admin control
  - Cons: Platform dependencies, approval processes

  Recommended Implementation Strategy:

  Phase 1: GitHub Releases + Tauri Updater
  Phase 2: Custom update server for enterprise features
  Phase 3: Enterprise platform integration

  ROADMAP.md Addition:

  ### Phase 4: Centralized Update Distribution
  - [ ] Implement Tauri auto-updater with GitHub Releases
  - [ ] Add update notification UI components
  - [ ] Configure code signing for secure updates
  - [ ] Build custom update server for enterprise deployments
  - [ ] Add update rollback mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement staged rollout capabilities
  - [ ] Enterprise MDM integration (SCCM, Intune)
  - [ ] Delta update optimization for bandwidth efficiency
  - [ ] Update analytics and reporting dashboard
  - [ ] Silent update mode for corporate environments

  Key Requirements:
  - Code signing certificates for security
  - Update server infrastructure (or GitHub Releases)
  - Version manifest management
  - Rollback mechanisms for failed updates
  - Enterprise policy compliance (update schedules, approval workflows)

  This would enable pushing security patches, new features, and bug fixes to all installed instances while
  maintaining legal industry security standards.
