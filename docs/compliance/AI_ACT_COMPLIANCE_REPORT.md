### 10.1 Technical Implementation Steps

1. **Integrate TransparencyNotice component:**
   - Import into App.tsx
   - Add state management for first-launch detection
   - Implement menu item in application menu
   - Connect to Rust backend commands (get_current_model, set_transparency_acknowledged)

2. **Backend Rust commands needed:**
   ```rust
   // Add to src-tauri/src/commands.rs
   #[tauri::command]
   fn get_current_model() -> String { ... }

   #[tauri::command]
   fn set_transparency_acknowledged() -> Result<(), String> { ... }

   #[tauri::command]
   fn open_model_cards_folder() -> Result<(), String> { ... }
   ```

3. **First-run detection:**
   - Check if transparency acknowledgment file exists
   - If not, show TransparencyNotice before main app
   - Save acknowledgment to persistent storage

4. **Model cards accessibility:**
   - Add function to open model cards folder in file explorer
   - Consider in-app TOML viewer for better UX
   - Link from TransparencyNotice component

### 10.2 User Communication

**On First Launch:**
1. Show SetupWizard (existing)
2. Show TransparencyNotice (new) with mandatory acknowledgment
3. Proceed to main application

**In Application:**
1. Menu: "Help" → "About AI System" → Opens TransparencyNotice
2. Menu: "Help" → "Model Cards" → Opens model_cards folder
3. Footer message: "BEAR AI uses local models. Your data never leaves your device."
4. Model selector: Info icon opens model-specific card
