## Overview

BEAR AI LLM is designed as a **local-first** application to minimize reliance on third-party data processors. All core functionality operates without external dependencies.

**Primary Principle:** User data remains on the user's device unless explicit consent is granted for specific external services.

### Data Controller vs. Data Processor

**BEAR AI (Data Controller):**
- Determines purposes and means of processing
- Maintains direct relationship with data subjects (users)
- Responsible for GDPR compliance

**Third-Party Processors (if used):**
- Process data on behalf of BEAR AI under instructions
- Subject to Article 28 requirements
- Must provide sufficient guarantees

## Processor Register

### Active Processors

#### 1. HuggingFace, Inc.

**Status:** ⚠️ **OPTIONAL** - Disabled by default, requires user opt-in

**Processor Information:**
- **Name:** HuggingFace, Inc.
- **Location:** United States (Delaware)
- **Data Center Locations:** USA (AWS), EU (CloudFlare CDN)
- **Website:** https://huggingface.co
- **Contact:** legal@huggingface.co
- **DPO:** Available via privacy@huggingface.co

**Processing Purpose:**

### Inactive/Historical Processors

#### 2. Microsoft Presidio (Not a Data Processor)

**Status:** ✅ **LOCAL TOOL** - Not a third-party data processor

**Clarification:**
Microsoft Presidio is an **open-source library** that runs entirely locally on the user's machine via Python. It does NOT:
- Send data to Microsoft servers
- Transmit data over the network
- Require an API key or account
- Constitute a third-country transfer

**Classification:** Technical tool, not a data processor under GDPR Article 28.

**Data Flow:**
```
User Document → Local Python Process (Presidio) → PII Detection Results
                      ↓
                 NO NETWORK TRANSMISSION
                      ↓
                 Local Database Storage
```

**Legal Analysis:**
- No Article 28 requirements (not a processor relationship)
- No third-country transfer (local execution)
- No DPA needed (open-source tool)
- Privacy-friendly architecture

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.8+ (local installation)
- Presidio-analyzer package (local)
- Presidio-anonymizer package (local)
- spaCy NLP models (downloaded once, cached locally)

**Security Considerations:**
- Regular security updates via pip (user responsibility)
- No telemetry or phone-home capabilities
- Offline operation supported

## Risk Assessment

### Third-Party Processing Risks

#### Risk 1: Unauthorized Data Access by Processor

**Scenario:** HuggingFace employee or system compromise leads to unauthorized access to user data.

**Likelihood:** Low (strong access controls, SOC 2 compliance)
**Impact:** High (PII exposure)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM**

**Mitigations:**
- HuggingFace access controls (role-based, MFA)
- Audit logging of all data access
- Regular security audits (SOC 2 Type II)
- BEAR AI: User opt-in only (minimize exposure)
- BEAR AI: Local alternative always available

**Residual Risk:** **LOW**

---

#### Risk 2: Third-Country Transfer to USA

**Scenario:** Data transferred to USA without adequate protection, subject to government surveillance (Schrems II concerns).

**Likelihood:** Medium (post-Schrems II legal uncertainty)
**Impact:** Medium (potential government access)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM**

**Mitigations:**
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in place
- HuggingFace transparency report (government requests disclosed)
- User consent required (informed decision)
- BEAR AI: Encrypt data before transmission (TLS 1.3)
- BEAR AI: Local processing as default (no transfer)

**Additional Safeguards Recommended:**
- Monitor for EU adequacy decision (Data Privacy Framework)
- Prepare for alternative EU-based providers if needed
- Annual review of Schrems II case law

**Residual Risk:** **MEDIUM-LOW**

---

#### Risk 3: Sub-Processor Changes

**Scenario:** HuggingFace adds new sub-processor (e.g., different cloud provider) without notice.

**Likelihood:** Low (DPA requires notification)
**Impact:** Medium (new security risks)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM-LOW**

**Mitigations:**
- DPA Section 5: HuggingFace must notify of sub-processor changes
- BEAR AI review: Assess new sub-processor security
- User notification: Inform users of material changes
- Opt-out option: Users can disable HuggingFace integration

**Monitoring:**
- Quarterly review of HuggingFace sub-processor list
- Subscribe to HuggingFace security updates
- Document all sub-processor changes

**Residual Risk:** **LOW**

---

#### Risk 4: Data Breach at Processor

**Scenario:** HuggingFace suffers data breach affecting user data.

**Likelihood:** Low (strong security, no history of major breaches)
**Impact:** High (PII exposure, reputational damage)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM**

**Mitigations:**
- HuggingFace incident response plan (< 24h notification)
- DPA requires immediate breach notification to BEAR AI
- BEAR AI: Notify affected users within 72 hours (GDPR Article 33/34)
- Insurance: HuggingFace carries cyber insurance

**Incident Response Plan:**
1. HuggingFace detects breach → Notifies BEAR AI within 24h
2. BEAR AI assesses impact → Determines affected users
3. BEAR AI notifies supervisory authority within 72h (if required)
4. BEAR AI notifies affected users (if high risk)
5. BEAR AI assists users with protective measures
6. Post-incident: Review processor relationship, consider alternatives

**Residual Risk:** **LOW**
