## GDPR Privacy Risks

### Risk Category 1: Data Minimization (Article 5(1)(c))

**Risk Description:**
Excessive collection or retention of personal data beyond what is necessary for processing purposes.

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM-LOW**

**Specific Concerns:**
- Chat messages may contain more context than needed for AI responses
- Document processing stores full text even when only excerpts are needed
- Audit logs accumulate user behavior patterns over time

**Evidence:**
- Default retention: 90 days (chats), 2 years (documents) - relatively short
- Configurable retention allows user control
- PII metadata stored without original text (good practice)

**Mitigation Status:** ‚úÖ Adequate
- Automated retention cleanup (`RetentionManager`)
- User-configurable retention periods
- Chunking reduces document storage footprint
- Audit logs limited to 2 years

**Residual Risk:** **LOW**

---

### Risk Category 2: Special Categories Processing (Article 9)

**Risk Description:**
Legal documents may contain sensitive data (health, criminal convictions, biometric data, racial/ethnic origin) which require heightened protection.

**Likelihood:** High (legal documents frequently contain Article 9 data)
**Impact:** High (severe privacy violation if leaked)
**Overall Risk:** **HIGH**

**Specific Concerns:**
- Medical malpractice cases contain health data
- Criminal defense files contain conviction data
- Immigration cases may contain biometric/racial data
- Family law cases contain intimate personal details

**Evidence:**
- No automatic special category filtering
- PII detection may miss context-dependent sensitive data
- Vector embeddings could theoretically encode sensitive patterns

**Mitigation Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- PII detection catches some special categories (medical records, SSN)
- User control over document uploads (conscious decision)
- Local processing (no third-party access by default)
- Optional redaction before embedding

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **Enhanced detection:** Expand PII patterns to include:
   - Health condition keywords (diabetes, HIV, cancer, etc.)
   - Criminal offense terminology
   - Biometric identifiers (fingerprints, DNA, facial recognition IDs)

2. **User warnings:** Alert when special category data detected:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è This document may contain sensitive personal data (health/criminal records).
   Consider redacting before processing. [Review] [Redact] [Proceed]
   ```

3. **Separate consent:** Require explicit consent for special categories:
   ```rust
   ConsentType::SpecialCategoryProcessing // New consent type needed
   ```

**Residual Risk:** **MEDIUM** (after additional mitigations)

---

### Risk Category 3: Data Security (Article 32)

**Risk Description:**
Unauthorized access, accidental loss, or destruction of personal data due to inadequate security measures.

**Likelihood:** Low (local storage, no network exposure)
**Impact:** High (complete data breach)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM**

**Specific Concerns:**
- SQLite database not encrypted by default
- File system permissions rely on OS security
- Memory-resident data during processing (potential memory dumps)
- No authentication/authorization layer (single-user assumption)

**Evidence:**
- Code review shows no database encryption at `/src-tauri/src/database.rs`
- Connection pooling without authentication
- PII stored in-memory during detection

**Mitigation Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- OS-level file permissions protect database
- Rust memory safety prevents common vulnerabilities
- No network exposure (local-only)
- Secure deletion via VACUUM

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **Database Encryption:**
   ```rust
   // Use SQLCipher for transparent database encryption
   use sqlcipher::Connection;
   conn.execute("PRAGMA key = 'user-provided-passphrase'", [])?;
   ```

2. **Memory Protection:**
   - Use `secrecy` crate for sensitive data in memory
   - Implement memory wiping for PII after processing

3. **Authentication:**
   - Add optional user authentication layer
   - Encrypt exports with user password

**Residual Risk:** **LOW** (after encryption implementation)

**Likelihood:** Low (opt-in only, disabled by default)
**Impact:** Medium (potential surveillance by US authorities)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM-LOW**

**Specific Concerns:**
- HuggingFace servers in USA (post-Schrems II concerns)
- Cloud AI Act Article 28 GPAI requirements
- Potential for API logging on HuggingFace side
- User may not understand implications of remote processing

**Evidence:**
- Code shows optional HuggingFace integration (`/src-tauri/src/huggingface_api.rs`)
- Disabled by default (good practice)
- User consent required before first use

**Mitigation Status:** ‚úÖ Adequate
- **Opt-in only:** Remote processing disabled by default
- **Local alternative:** Always available (fallback to local models)
- **SCCs:** HuggingFace complies with Standard Contractual Clauses
- **Transparency:** User informed when remote API is used

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **Enhanced User Notice:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Remote AI Processing

   You are about to send data to HuggingFace (USA). This may include:
   ‚Ä¢ Document text (for embeddings)
   ‚Ä¢ Search queries

   Safeguards: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), HTTPS encryption
   Alternative: Use local models (Settings > AI Models > Local Only)

   [Cancel] [Use Local Models] [Proceed with Remote]
   ```

2. **Audit Trail:** Log which documents used remote processing
3. **Automatic Local Preference:** Remember user's choice to avoid repeated prompts

**Residual Risk:** **LOW**

---

### Risk Category 5: Consent Management (Article 7)

**Risk Description:**
Invalid consent (not freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous) or difficulty withdrawing consent.

**Likelihood:** Very Low (robust consent implementation)
**Impact:** Medium (processing without legal basis)
**Overall Risk:** **LOW**

## EU AI Act Risks

BEAR AI LLM uses AI systems (LLMs) for document processing and question answering. Risk classification under EU AI Act:

### AI System Classification

**System Type:** General-Purpose AI (GPAI) assistant
**Risk Level:** **LIMITED RISK** (Transparency obligations apply)

**Rationale:**
- Not prohibited (Article 5) - No social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance, or manipulation
- Not high-risk (Article 6) - No critical infrastructure, education scoring, employment decisions, or law enforcement use
- Transparency required (Article 50) - Users must know they're interacting with AI

**Applicable Requirements:**
- Article 50: Transparency - users informed of AI usage ‚úÖ
- Article 52: Record-keeping for GPAI providers (if distributing models)
- Article 53: Technical documentation

---

### AI Risk Category 1: Transparency (Article 50)

**Risk Description:**
Users unaware they are interacting with AI system, leading to misplaced trust or misunderstanding of capabilities.

**Likelihood:** Low (UI indicates AI usage)
**Impact:** Low (user confusion, not material harm)
**Overall Risk:** **LOW**

**Specific Concerns:**
- Users may assume AI responses are legally verified
- Model limitations not prominently displayed
- No clear indication of which parts are AI-generated vs. retrieved from documents

**Mitigation Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- Application name "BEAR AI" indicates AI usage
- Chat UI distinguishes user from AI messages
- Model name displayed in chat sessions

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **Prominent AI Disclaimer:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Assistant - Not Legal Advice

   BEAR AI uses artificial intelligence to assist with legal research.
   AI responses may contain errors and should be verified.
   This is not a substitute for professional legal counsel.
   ```

2. **Source Attribution:** Clearly mark which content comes from user documents vs. AI generation

3. **Confidence Indicators:** Show AI uncertainty (e.g., "I'm not sure about this...")

**Residual Risk:** **VERY LOW** (after disclaimer implementation)

---

### AI Risk Category 2: Hallucination & Accuracy (Article 15 - Accuracy Requirement)

**Risk Description:**
AI generates false information ("hallucinations") that users rely on for legal decisions, causing material harm.

**Likelihood:** Medium (inherent LLM limitation)
**Impact:** High (legal/financial consequences of wrong advice)
**Overall Risk:** **HIGH**

**Specific Concerns:**
- LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect legal citations
- RAG system may retrieve irrelevant document chunks
- User may not fact-check AI responses
- Legal domain has high accuracy requirements

**Evidence:**
- No fact-checking layer in current implementation
- RAG engine returns top-k results without verification
- Users can directly act on AI responses without review

**Mitigation Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Inadequate
- RAG grounding reduces hallucinations (retrieves real document content)
- User retains final decision-making authority (human-in-the-loop)
- No automated legal actions

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **Citation Verification:**
   ```
   AI Response: "According to Smith v. Jones (2020)..."

   [‚úì Verified in Document 3, Page 12]
   [‚ö†Ô∏è Citation Not Found in Your Documents]
   ```

2. **Confidence Scores:** Display retrieval confidence for each source

3. **Multiple Source Requirement:** Require corroboration before high-stakes answers

4. **Human Review Checkpoints:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Decision Point

   This response relates to a critical legal matter.
   Have you verified this information independently? [Yes] [No, review needed]
   ```

**Residual Risk:** **MEDIUM** (irreducible LLM uncertainty remains even with mitigations)

---

### AI Risk Category 3: Bias and Discrimination (Article 10)

**Risk Description:**
AI training data biases lead to discriminatory suggestions or unequal treatment of legal issues.

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on model choice)
**Impact:** Medium-High (legal/ethical implications)
**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM**

**Specific Concerns:**
- LLMs trained on historical legal data may encode systemic biases
- Underrepresentation of minority legal perspectives
- Gender/racial bias in language generation
- Criminal justice bias (e.g., harsher language for certain demographics)

**Evidence:**
- User controls model selection (can choose less biased models)
- No automated decision-making (user reviews all outputs)
- Local deployment reduces bias amplification

**Mitigation Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- Human oversight (user reviews AI outputs)
- No automated decisions
- User can switch models

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **Bias Testing:** Regular evaluation of AI outputs for discriminatory patterns

2. **Model Selection Guidance:**
   ```
   Model Selection

   GPT-4: General-purpose, moderate bias mitigation
   Claude: Strong ethics training, reduced bias
   Local Llama: User-controlled, bias depends on fine-tuning

   [Learn More About Bias in AI]
   ```

3. **Bias Warnings:** Flag potentially sensitive legal areas (e.g., employment discrimination, criminal defense)

**Residual Risk:** **MEDIUM-LOW** (human oversight prevents automated discrimination)

---

### AI Risk Category 4: Data Governance for AI Training (Article 10)

**Risk Description:**
User data inadvertently used to train AI models without consent, exposing personal data to model providers.

**Likelihood:** Very Low (local processing, no training feedback loop)
**Impact:** High (unauthorized data usage)
**Overall Risk:** **LOW**

**Specific Concerns:**
- HuggingFace API may log requests for model improvement
- Embeddings could theoretically leak information back to providers
- Future updates might enable telemetry

**Mitigation Status:** ‚úÖ Adequate
- Local-first processing (no data leaves device by default)
- HuggingFace API opt-in only
- No automatic telemetry or error reporting with user data

**Additional Mitigations Recommended:**
1. **API Terms Review:** Verify HuggingFace doesn't use API data for training

2. **Telemetry Control:**
   ```
   [ ] Share anonymized error reports to improve BEAR AI
   [ ] Allow usage analytics (no personal data)

   Your documents and chats are NEVER shared.
   ```

**Residual Risk:** **VERY LOW**
