## 🤖 Agent Types and Functions

### 1. Query Analysis Agent
**Purpose**: Understand user intent and query complexity

**Functions**:
- Intent classification (factual, analytical, comparative, procedural)
- Complexity assessment (simple, moderate, complex, multi-document)
- Entity extraction (people, organizations, dates, legal terms)
- Question type identification (what, how, why, when, where)

**Example**:
```
Input: "What are the termination clauses in my employment contracts?"
Analysis:
- Intent: Factual extraction
- Complexity: Moderate (multiple documents)
- Entities: ["termination clauses", "employment contracts"]
- Type: What (extraction query)
```

### 2. Query Rewriting Agent
**Purpose**: Generate multiple query formulations for better retrieval

**Strategies**:
- **Semantic Expansion**: Add related legal terms and synonyms
- **Specificity Levels**: Create both broad and narrow variants
- **Perspective Shifting**: Rephrase from different viewpoints
- **Legal Context**: Add jurisdiction and practice area context

**Example**:
```
Original: "liability issues in the contract"
Rewrites:
1. "liability clauses, indemnification, and limitation of damages"
2. "legal responsibility and financial exposure provisions"
3. "contractual liability allocation and risk management"
4. "damages, warranties, and hold harmless agreements"
```

### 3. Semantic Retrieval Agent
**Purpose**: Find relevant document chunks using advanced search

**Methods**:
- **Vector Similarity**: Dense embeddings for semantic matching
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and semantic search
- **Contextual Ranking**: Considers document relationships
- **Legal Taxonomy**: Uses legal concept hierarchies

**Retrieval Process**:
1. Execute multiple query variants
2. Aggregate results from different search methods
3. Remove duplicates and near-duplicates
4. Apply relevance thresholds
5. Return top candidates with scores

### 4. Context Ranking Agent
**Purpose**: Prioritize and score retrieved content

**Ranking Factors**:
- **Semantic Relevance** (0-1): Vector similarity score
- **Keyword Overlap** (0-1): Term frequency matching
- **Document Authority** (0-1): Source credibility and recency
- **Context Completeness** (0-1): Whether chunk provides complete information
- **Legal Relevance** (0-1): Domain-specific importance

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Final Score = (0.3 × Semantic) + (0.2 × Keyword) + (0.2 × Authority) + (0.15 × Completeness) + (0.15 × Legal)
```

### 5. Answer Synthesis Agent
**Purpose**: Generate coherent responses from multiple sources

**Synthesis Strategies**:
- **Extractive**: Direct quotes with attribution
- **Abstractive**: Paraphrased summaries
- **Comparative**: Side-by-side analysis of different sources
- **Synthesis**: Combining information from multiple documents

**Response Structure**:
1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings in 1-2 sentences
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive explanation with evidence
3. **Source Citations**: Specific references with relevance scores
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Overall reliability indicator

### 6. Quality Assessment Agent
**Purpose**: Validate response quality and provide confidence metrics

**Assessment Criteria**:
- **Completeness** (0-1): Does the answer address all parts of the question?
- **Accuracy** (0-1): Are the facts and citations correct?
- **Relevance** (0-1): How well does the answer match the query intent?
- **Coherence** (0-1): Is the response logically structured?
- **Coverage** (0-1): Are multiple perspectives represented?

**Confidence Calculation**:
```
Confidence = (Completeness + Accuracy + Relevance + Coherence + Coverage) / 5
```

## 🎯 Use Cases and Examples

### Legal Document Analysis

**Query**: "What are the intellectual property provisions across all our vendor agreements?"

**Agentic RAG Process**:
1. **Analysis**: Identifies need for cross-document comparison
2. **Rewriting**: Generates variants including "IP rights", "proprietary information", "trade secrets"
3. **Retrieval**: Searches all vendor agreements for relevant sections
4. **Ranking**: Prioritizes clauses with highest legal relevance
5. **Synthesis**: Creates comparative analysis with contract-specific details
6. **Quality Check**: Ensures completeness and accuracy

**Response**:
```
Executive Summary: Your vendor agreements contain varied IP protection levels, with 3 contracts having comprehensive clauses and 2 requiring strengthening.

Detailed Analysis:
- **Acme Corp Contract (2023)**: Strong IP protection with detailed ownership clauses [Confidence: 0.92]
- **Beta Solutions Agreement**: Moderate protection, limited work-for-hire provisions [Confidence: 0.87]
