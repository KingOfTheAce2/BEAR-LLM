## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### 1. Unified AppState Design

```rust
pub struct AppState {
    // NEW: Security & Encryption
    chat_encryption: Arc<RwLock<ChatEncryption>>,
    key_manager: Arc<KeyManager>,

    // NEW: AI Transparency
    model_card_fetcher: Arc<RwLock<ModelCardFetcher>>,
    model_transparency: Arc<ModelTransparencyState>,

    // NEW: PII Configuration
    pii_config_manager: Arc<RwLock<PIIConfigManager>>,
    memory_manager: Arc<MemoryManager>,

    // EXISTING: Core Services
    consent_guard: Arc<ConsentGuard>,
    compliance_manager: Arc<ComplianceManager>,
    transparency_state: Arc<TransparencyState>,
    pii_detector: Arc<RwLock<PIIDetector>>,
    // ... rest
}
```

### 2. Critical Integration Flows

#### Chat Message Flow
```
User Input → Consent Check → Model Disclaimer → PII Detection
→ Encryption → Database Storage → Audit Log
```

#### Model Loading Flow
```
Model Selection → Fetch Model Card → Check Acknowledgment
→ Show Disclaimer → User ACK → Load Weights
```

#### PII Configuration Flow
```
Detect System RAM → Select PII Mode → Check Presidio
→ Initialize Mode → Update UI
```
