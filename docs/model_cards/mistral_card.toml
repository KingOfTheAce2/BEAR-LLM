description = """
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B models and competes
with models 2-3x larger on many benchmarks. The extended 32k context window is a significant
advantage for document processing. 4-bit quantization reduces performance by ~8-12% compared
to full precision but remains highly capable.

Sliding Window Attention allows effective processing of long documents while maintaining
computational efficiency. Real-world performance on legal and professional documents exceeds
benchmark scores due to instruction tuning.

# Compliance Statement
[compliance_statement]
statement = """
This model card is provided in compliance with the EU AI Act Article 53 (Technical Documentation)
and Article 13 (Transparency and Provision of Information to Deployers). Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
is deployed in BEAR AI LLM as part of a high-risk AI system for professional and legal document
assistance.

Mistral-7B represents the highest quality option in BEAR AI's local model offerings, providing
advanced reasoning, extended context windows, and strong performance on professional tasks.
However, even this advanced model has important limitations:

1. NOT A REPLACEMENT for licensed professionals (attorneys, doctors, financial advisors)
2. REQUIRES MANDATORY HUMAN OVERSIGHT for all critical decisions and professional outputs
3. MAY PRODUCE ERRORS, HALLUCINATIONS, OR BIASED OUTPUTS despite advanced capabilities
4. SHOULD BE USED for assistance, research, and drafting - NOT as final authority
5. EXTENDED CONTEXT processing increases both capability and potential for subtle errors

All outputs must be thoroughly reviewed by qualified professionals before reliance in
professional, legal, medical, or financial contexts. This model is a powerful tool to
augment human expertise, not replace it.

Users must ensure compliance with applicable regulations (EU AI Act, GDPR, professional
ethics rules) when deploying this model in professional contexts.
