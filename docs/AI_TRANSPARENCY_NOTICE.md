## System Identification

**System Name:** BEAR AI LLM (Business Enterprise AI Resource - Large Language Model)
**System Type:** General-Purpose AI System with High-Risk Applications
**Provider:** Ernst van Gassen
**Version:** 1.0.24

---

## Risk Classification

**Risk Level:** **HIGH-RISK SYSTEM** (EU AI Act Annex III)

This system is classified as high-risk under the EU AI Act because it:
- Processes legal documents and professional materials
- Performs document analysis that may inform legal or business decisions
- Handles potentially sensitive personal and professional information
- Provides outputs that users may rely upon in professional contexts

**Note:** While classified as high-risk due to potential use cases, this system is designed for assistance only and must not replace professional judgment.

## Limitations and Risks

### Known Limitations

1. **Not a Legal Professional**
   - Cannot provide legal advice or professional opinions
   - Outputs are informational only and require expert verification
   - No guarantee of legal accuracy or compliance

2. **Model Size Constraints**
   - Smaller models (TinyLlama, Phi-2) may have reduced reasoning capability
   - Limited context window (2,048-4,096 tokens typical)
   - May struggle with highly specialized or technical content

3. **PII Detection Accuracy**
   - Built-in detection: ~75-85% accuracy (pattern-based)
   - Presidio enhancement: ~85-95% accuracy (NER-based)
   - **False positives:** May flag non-sensitive text
   - **False negatives:** May miss novel or obfuscated PII patterns
   - **Critical:** Never rely solely on automated PII detection for compliance

4. **Language Support**
   - Optimized for English language
   - Limited support for other languages
   - Translation quality varies by model

5. **Knowledge Cutoff**
   - Models trained on data with specific cutoff dates
   - No real-time information or internet access
   - Cannot access current events or recent changes in law

6. **Hallucination Risk**
   - AI may generate plausible but incorrect information
   - Outputs should always be verified by qualified professionals
   - No guarantee of factual accuracy

### Risk Mitigation Measures

**Human Oversight Requirements:**
- All outputs require professional review before reliance
- System displays warnings about limitations
- Transparency notice shown on first launch

**Technical Safeguards:**
- Local processing prevents data leakage
- PII protection automatically activates
- Secure storage with encryption
- No telemetry or tracking

**User Responsibilities:**
